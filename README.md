A MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack Game E-commerce store! 🎮🛒

As an avid gamer and aspiring developer, I decided to embark on this journey for the pure joy of learning and honing my skills in web development, particularly in the realm of e-commerce and payment integration using Stripe. 💳💻
Here's a glimpse into what I've been working on:

🎮 Curated Game Collection: Here I had listed tons of popular games with the help of RAWG games database...

🌐 Seamless User Experience: Utilizing the power of React, I've built a intuitive website design to ensure that browsing, selecting, and purchasing games is a breeze.

💰 Secure Payments with Stripe: My primary focus is on mastering payment integration, and I chose Stripe for its robust security and ease of use. It's been a fantastic learning experience to ensure that every transaction is smooth and secure.

📚 Ongoing Learning: While this project may not be a commercial venture, it's an ongoing journey of discovery. I'm constantly expanding my knowledge and staying up-to-date with the latest web development trends.
